This project explores the use of text and image data to recommend popular English books. It involves data preprocessing, clustering, association rule mining, and model evaluation.


Multimodal Book Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the development of my master's thesis project, which aims to build a recommendation system for popular English-language books using machine learning techniques. The approach is multimodal, combining textual data (titles, descriptions, ratings) and visual information (book covers) to generate more accurate and personalized recommendations.

Key components of the project include:

Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing of the Popular Books Dataset from Kaggle.

Implementation of clustering algorithms and association rule mining.

Development of recommendation models using both text and images.

Evaluation of the system using relevant recommender system metrics.

Final delivery of results and a functional prototype.

This work is part of the Masterâ€™s program in Data Analysis and is currently in progress.
